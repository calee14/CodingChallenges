This problem was asked by Facebook.
Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random element
from the stream with uniform probability.
'''
'''
Note:
Let the current element's index be i.
Choose to 'remember' the current element at probability 1/i. When EOF is reached,
produced the element you remember.
At the end, for each element with index i there is a probability to be chosen:

A formal prove can be done using induction, following these guidelines.
