This problem was asked by Google.

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.

XOR Linked List:

num_A = 0           XOR     address(B)
num_B = address(A)  XOR     address(C)

I think this problem will only show up for C and C++.
There is no way to do it in python or JAVA.
